                <p class="Paragraph">
                    Currently I am a student of Bow Valley College pursuing a degree in software development. 
                    However, I have only recently come to Canada and am still unfamiliar with life here.
                </p>
                <p class="Paragraph">
                    I am a transfer student coming from the Philippines but I spent the majority of my life in the US. 
                    I lived in the US for about 12-13 years where I went through my grade school years, learning a lot both in terms of classes and in terms of myself and how I feel about the world. 
                    Oftentimes I feel a little homesick, missing the people and places I used to frequent so often. 
                    However when I look back, I become emboldened, like my strength comes back to me as I feel the push to better myself in every way possible so that when I come eye to eye with my past again, I can look forward with confidence. 
                    What better place to do such a thing than in a completely unfamiliar country where I spend my time alone, learning everything about how to take care of myself and what I need to do to improve!

            <p class="Paragraph">
                In my everyday life, I spend a lot of time doing the things that I personally enjoy! 
                Some of the things that I enjoy doing include listening and playing music, playing games, cooking, and watching various movies and serieses that catch my interest. 
                As of recently because I am living alone, I find myself having to spend a decent portion of my time cooking. 
                While it feels tedious at times, I have to cook my own meals to save money from trying to eat outside.
                Though unintentional, cooking my own meals has given me a huge appreciation of how much my parents worked to provide homemade food to me when I lived with them.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">
                Whenever I get the time, I love to watch movies and serieses that catch my interests. 
                I don’t really limit myself to certain styles of media and just go with whatever I feel like watching, but I find myself consuming a lot of Korean drama and anime, as well as many films from my childhood.
                Some of my favorite films include When the Weather is Nice, Hotel Del Luna, Singles Inferno, Demon Slayer, Ancient Magus Bride, My Hero Academia, Weathering With You, Your Name, and Waiting for Rain.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">
                Though I don’t get a lot of time these days, I also like to play video games, on my own or with friends, to relax and unwind from the stresses of school and other work. 
                I don’t tend to play a multitude of games and instead just like to play a select few to keep myself entertained. 
                The games I currently play are Genshin Impact, Nikke: Goddess of Victory, and Minecraft.
            </p>
            <p class="Paragraph">
                Continuing, the majority of my free time as well as when I am working around the house, whether it be doing chores or doing schoolwork, is spent listening to music. 
                There isn’t a day that passes without me listening to music; music is the method through which I carry out my life. 
                The music I listen to mostly consists of either asian music or percussive music. 
                Some of my favorite asian artists include Fromis_9, NewJeans, TXT, Zico, Crush, Bol4, Hololive Music Studio, LiSa, JUNNA, and Radwimps. 
                On the percussive side, I enjoy listening to pieces from various DCI marching bands and solo music by Pius Cheung.

            <u class="SubHeading">Percussion Background</u>
            <p class="Paragraph">
                Regarding my interests in percussive music, I have about 10 years of experience playing percussive instruments, 7 of those years spent in a music education provided by my school district. 
                My favorite instruments to play are the snare drum, marimba, and vibraphone. 
                During my high school years, my percussion directors ran a YouTube channel that worked to both show educational content for students as well as recordings of ensemble and solo work from the upperclassmen to show to younger students to both show them what is possible in the program and to inspire them to work harder to be able to play interesting music.

                Here are some of the recordings from my solo work (Images are linked to YouTube video performance):
